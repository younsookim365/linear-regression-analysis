# Linear Regression Analysis
Linear regression analysis conducted in Python using Jupyter Notebook.  

## Chosen Data Set and Its Suitability for Linear Regression Analysis
The selected dataset focuses on Delhi's air quality, particularly the particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) concentration, and includes various independent variables such as carbon monoxide, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and other air pollutants. Linear regression is an appropriate analysis method due to the dataset's continuous dependent variable and the assumption that changes in independent variables linearly impact air pollution levels. The dataset's ample observations enhance the accuracy of the linear regression model.

## Analysis Objectives
The analysis aims to employ linear regression to establish relationships between PM2.5 concentration and independent variables, identifying significant contributors to PM2.5 levels. By fitting a linear model, coefficients of independent variables will be estimated, indicating the strength and direction of relationships. The ultimate goal is to predict PM2.5 concentration based on independent variable values. The analysis seeks to answer the question: Can we predict Delhi's PM2.5 concentration based on other air quality features?
